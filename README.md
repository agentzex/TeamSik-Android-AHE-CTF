Solutions to TeamSIK AHE16 Android CTFs

On both CTFs, the challenge is to enter the right flag on the apk.

For the first CTF - there are 2 python scripts implementing 2 different methods to solve it.\
For the second CTF - you can find both the edited .smali file I used in order to crack the app (for the added parts, search for '#edited_cracked'), or the other solution with the screenshots of the flag from IDA (from the libpassword.so file)
